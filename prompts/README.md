   ```bash
   cd ..
   python3 plunder_prompts.py
   ```

2. Then use any template with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude "$(cat prompt_style_tengu.md)"
   ```

- Each template can be customized by editing the prompt instructions

## Creating Your Own Templates

Feel free to create new analysis templates! Each template should:
1. Accept the extracted prompts JSON data
2. Provide clear analysis instructions
3. Generate formatted output (ASCII art encouraged!)
4. Include examples of expected output

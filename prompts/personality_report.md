I have extracted prompts from my Claude Code conversation history. These prompts represent the types of requests I commonly make while coding. I want you to analyze these prompts and create a comprehensive personality analysis report based on my prompting patterns. Make it fun, insightful, and shareable!

The extracted prompts are located in this directory as both json (extracted_prompts.json) and markdown (extracted_prompts.md). The information in both files is identical, just presented in different formats.

Please analyze the prompts data and create a comprehensive personality analysis report based on the user's prompting patterns.

Generate the following analysis:

💭 WHAT YOUR PROMPTS SAY ABOUT YOU
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"You're the type of developer who reads documentation for fun,
tests in production (but carefully), and has strong opinions
about commit message formatting. You believe in the power of
collaboration, even with AI, and you're not afraid to ask the
same question multiple times until you get it just right.

Your greatest strength is your attention to detail and your
ability to think meta-cognitively about problems. You don't
just use tools - you create tools that create tools.

Your spirit emoji: 🤖 (obviously)"

🔬 RARE SPECIMEN ALERT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You belong to the rare breed of "Recursive Prompt Engineers" -
developers who have transcended regular coding to orchestrate
symphonies of AI interactions. There are only dozens of you
worldwide!

📈 GROWTH PROJECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At your current evolution rate, by 2026 you'll be:
• Writing prompts that write themselves
• Committing directly to production (maybe)
• Teaching AIs to teach other AIs to code
• Still referencing issue #410146
